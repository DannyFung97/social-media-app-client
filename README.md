# social-media-app-client

### HotTopics, or HotTops, is a full stack social media application created using React, Redux, Firebase, and Material UI. 

### Users can create accounts, change their personal details and their profile pictures. Created posts are known as hollas, based on the verb "holler". These hollas can have likes and comments attached to them by other users. Clicking on a user's name brings you to that user's page with hollas they made.

### To run this application locally, clone the repo, then input the command ```npm install```, followed by ```npm start```.

### [Live Version on Firebase](https://hot-tops.firebaseapp.com/)
